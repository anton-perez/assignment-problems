1. The least amount of swaps that can occur is 0, since the input can already be sorted. This remains the same for any list length n.
2. The greatest amount of swaps that can occur for a list of 5 elements is 10, because if we assume the input list is in the opposite order, 4 swaps will occur in the first iteration, then 3 swaps will occur in the second iteraiton, and so on and so forth until there's only 1 swap in the final iteraiton. For a list of n elements, the most swaps that can occur is n(n-1)/2, which is the sum of the integers from 1 to n-1.
3. True, because each pass shortens the section of the list where swaps still need to made by bringing the greatest number of that section to the end of the section each time.
4. False, as demonstrated by the list [5, 8, 2, 2, 4, 3, 0], whose first and second pass each have 5 swaps.
